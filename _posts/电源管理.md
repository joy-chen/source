Android includes the following battery life enhancements:
* App Standby. The platform can place unused applications in App Standby mode, temporarily restricting network access and deferring syncs and jobs for those applications.
* Doze. The platform can enter a state of deep sleep (periodically resuming normal operations) if users have not actively used their device (screen off and stationary) for extended periods of time. Android 7.0 also enables Doze to trigger a lighter set of optimizations when users turn off the device screen yet continue to move around.
* Exemptions. System apps and cloud messaging services preloaded on a device are typically exempted from App Standby and Doze by default (although app developers can intent their applications into this setting). Users can exempt applications via the Settings menu.
